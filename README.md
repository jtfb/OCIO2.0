# OCIO 2.0 Implementation Tool
## Overview
This tool was created to streamline the implementation of OpenColorIO (OCIO) version 2.0 in visual effects, animation, and post-production workflows. It helps professionals manage color spaces efficiently, ensuring seamless integration with industry standards.

## Situation
With the growing demand for accurate color management in digital content creation, many studios are transitioning to OCIO 2.0 to ensure consistency across platforms and devices. However, the complexity of configuring OCIO 2.0 can make it a challenging process, especially for smaller teams without dedicated pipeline developers.

## Task
The primary task was to create a tool that simplifies the adoption of OCIO 2.0, providing a solution that could automate parts of the setup, make it easier to manage color spaces, and reduce manual errors. The goal was to make this tool accessible to professionals working in VFX, animation, or post-production who need to ensure color accuracy.

## Action
I developed this tool with an intuitive interface, making it user-friendly even for teams without deep technical knowledge of OCIO. The tool automates key tasks such as creating configuration files, managing LUTs (Look-Up Tables), and setting up color transformations. By leveraging Python and OCIO's native API, the tool ensures compatibility and flexibility with existing workflows.

## Result
The result is a tool that accelerates the implementation of OCIO 2.0, reducing setup times from hours to minutes and ensuring consistent color management across projects. Studios and individuals using this tool report fewer errors in their color pipelines, allowing them to focus on creativity rather than technical details.

## Features
Automated OCIO Configuration: Automatically generates OCIO config files based on your project needs.
Color Space Management: Easily switch between and manage different color spaces and transformations.
LUT Management: Supports the use of custom and standardized LUTs.
Seamless Integration: Works smoothly with popular software like Nuke, Maya, and Blender.
Installation
To install the tool, clone the repository and place the file where you will set the OCIO in your pipeline.
